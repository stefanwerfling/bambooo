# Bambooo
AdminLTE Typescript Framework (The basic idea of the name is to build the front end like a bamboo frame.)

"Never repeat yourself" is one of the most important attitudes of a programmer. 
Since I now have several projects that I use with the same basic framework for a chic admin front end, 
I have now decided to outsource this as an extra project and thus make it easier to maintain the code.

## Installation
First, the following packages must be installed:
```shell
npm i admin-lte
npm i ionicons-css
npm i jquery
npm i jquery-ui-dist
```

For dev:
```shell
npm i --save-dev @types/jquery
```

## First use over Express Server
